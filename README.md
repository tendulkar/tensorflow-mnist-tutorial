Adding my code on top of "[Tensorflow and deep learning - without a PhD](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist)"

The presentation explaining the underlying concepts is [here](https://goo.gl/pHeXe7) and you will find codelab instructions to follow on its last slide. Do not forget to open the speaker notes in the presentation, a lot of the explanations are there.

The lab takes 2.5 hours and takes you through the design and optimisation of a neural network for recognising handwritten digits, from the simplest possible solution all the way to a recognition accuracy above 99%. It covers dense and convolutional networks, as well as techniques such as learning rate decay and dropout.

Installation instructions [here](INSTALL.txt). The short version is: install Python3, then pip3 install tensorflow and matplotlib.
